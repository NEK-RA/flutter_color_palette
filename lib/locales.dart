export 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
/*
By default according to https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization
Packages:
- flutter_localization
- intl
added to dependecies.

The generated localizations are located by default at: 
project_folder/.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n

and file for import is app_localizations.dart

So finally the url to import is:
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';

But, VSCode doesn't suggest to import it, so, this "locales.dart" file exporting the 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart' for VSCode to suggest imports for the AppLocalizations class to be able to use.
